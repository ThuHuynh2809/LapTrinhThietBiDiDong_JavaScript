// 2. After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64 was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.

gameEvents.delete(64);
console.log(gameEvents);

// 3. Compute and log the following string to the console: "An event happened, on average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)

const totalTime = 90; // Total game time in minutes
console.log(
  `An event happened, on average, every ${totalTime / gameEvents.size} minutes`
);

// 4. Loop over 'gameEvents' and log each element to the console, marking whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:


for (const [key, value] of gameEvents) {
  const half = key <= 45 ? 'FIRST' : 'SECOND';
  console.log(`[${half} HALF] ${key}: ${value}`);
}

// [FIRST HALF] 17: ⚽ GOAL
